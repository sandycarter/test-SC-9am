## R Markdown

### Load Packages and Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
oil_spills <- read_csv("oil_spills.csv")
```

### Make column graph of Texas Oil Spills
```{r, message=FALSE}
df <- oil_spills %>% 
  filter(`Accident State` == "TX" & `Accident Year` < 2017) %>% 
  group_by(`Accident Year`) %>%  # Create groups by different years so we can find net oil loss by year
  summarise(Loss = sum(`Net Loss (Barrels)`))

colnames(df) <- c("Year", "Loss")

ggplot(df, aes(x = Year, y = Loss)) +
  geom_col()
# Loss is in barrels. This is about 1/2 as much as Exxon Valdez. (but land to marine is apples/oranges)
```
